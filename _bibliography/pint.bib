The transient stability problem is viewed as a coupled set of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations; by applying a discretization method such as the trapezoidal rule, the overall algebraic-differential set of equations is thus transformed into an unique algebraic problem at each time step. A solution that considers every time step, not in a sequential way but concurrently, is suggested. The solution of this set of equations with a relaxation-type indirect method gives rise to a highly parallel algorithm. The method can handle all the typical dynamic models of realistic power system components. Test results are presented and shown to favorably compare with those obtained with the sequential dishonest Newton algorithm for realistic power systems}},

By applying a stable integration method, the overall algebraic-differential set of equations can be transformed into a unique algebraic problem at each time step. The dynamic behavior of the system can be obtained by solving an enlarged set of algebraic equations relative to the simultaneous solution of many time steps. A class of relaxation/Newton algorithms can be used to solve this problem efficiently. This formulation permits easy implementation of multigrid techniques. The convergence rates and computational complexity of the algorithms are discussed. Test results for realistic power systems confirm theoretical expectations and show the promise of a several-fold increase in speed over that obtainable by traditional parallel-in-space approaches. The synergism obtainable by parallelism in time and in space can provide speed-up adequate for online implementations of transient stability analysis}},

@article{Sommeijer1993,
	abstract = {For the numerical integration of a stiff ordinary differential equation, fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods offer nice properties, like a high classical order and high stage order as well as an excellent stability behaviour. However, such methods need the solution of a set of highly coupled equations for the stage values and this is a considerable computational task. This paper discusses an iteration scheme to tackle this problem. By means of a suitable choice of the iteration parameters, the implicit relations for the stage values, as they occur in each iteration, can be uncoupled so that they can be solved in parallel. The resulting scheme can be cast into the class of Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods and, similar to these methods, requires only one LU factorization per step (per processor). The stability as well as the computational efficiency of the process strongly depends on the particular choice of the iteration parameters and on the number of iterations performed. We discuss several choices to obtain good stability and fast convergence. Based on these approaches, we wrote two codes possessing local error control and stepsize variation. We have implemented both codes on an ALLIANT FX/4 machine (four parallel vector processors and shared memory) and measured their speedup factors for a number of test problems. Furthermore, the performance of these codes is compared with the performance of the best stiff ODE codes for sequential computers, like SIMPLE, LSODE and RADAU5.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze parallel, diagonally implicit iteration of Runge-Kutta methods (PDIRK methods) for solving large systems of stiff equations on parallel computers. Like Newton-iterated backward differentiation formulas (BDFs), these PDIRK methods are such that in each step the (sequential) costs consist of solving a number of linear systems with the same matrix of coefficients and with the same dimension as the system of differential equations. Although for PDIRK methods the number of linear systems is usually higher than for Newton iteration of BDFs, the more computationally intensive work of computing the matrix of coefficients and its LU-decomposition are identical. The advantage of PDIRK methods over Newton-iterated BDFs is their unconditional stability (A-stability for Gauss-based methods and L-stability for Radau-based methods) for any order of accuracy. Special characteristics of the PDIRK methods will be studied, such as the rate of convergence, the influence of particular predictors on the resulting stability properties, and the stiff error constants in the global error.},

@article{Wang1998,
	abstract = {{The paper presents a new parallel method for the transient stability analysis of power systems. For simplicity, the classical power system model is adopted. The implicit trapezoidal rule is used to discretise the set of differential equations which describes the transient stability problem. As is well known, these discretised nonlinear algebraic equations are almost invariably solved by a Newton procedure. A parallel-in-time relaxed Newton method is proposed to solve the overall set of discretised equations concurrently on all the time steps. The proposed method has been tested on Cray-T3D by the use of PVM system. The test results show that the proposed method presents a good compromise between parallelism-in-time and convergence. Some important aspects for parallel transient stability analysis have been clarified}},

across the method.
The essential feature is that in each time step $s$ 'peer' approximations are employed having similar properties.
In fact, no primary solution variable is distinguished.
Parallel implementation of these stages is easy since information from one previous time step is used only and
the different linear systems may be solved simultaneously.
This paper introduces a subclass having order $s-1$ where optimal damping for stiff problems is obtained by using
different system parameters in different stages.
Favourable properties of this subclass are uniform stability for realistic stepsize sequences and a
superconvergence property which is proved using a polynomial collocation formulation.
Numerical tests on a shared memory computer of a matrix-free implementation with Krylov methods are included.}},

solve the time-dependent problems parallel in time.
This algorithm has received much interest from many researchers in the past years.
We present in this paper a new variant of the parareal algorithm, which is derived by combining the
original parareal algorithm and the Richardson extrapolation, for the numerical solution of the
nonlinear ODEs and PDEs.
Several nonlinear problems are tested to show the advantage of the new algorithm.
The accuracy of the obtained numerical solution is compared with that of its original version (i.e.,
the parareal algorithm based on the same numerical method).}},

	abstract = {{Time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation is commonly used to solve time dependent partial differential equations. Computation in each time step is carried out using all processors available before sequentially advancing to the next time step. In cases where few spatial components are involved and there are relatively many processors available for use, this will result in fine granularity and decreased scalability. Naturally one alternative is to parallelise the temporal domain. Several time parallelisation algorithms have been suggested for the past two decades. One of them is the pipelined iterations across time steps. In this pipelined time stepping method, communication however is extensive between time steps during the pipelining process. This causes a decrease in performance on distributed memory environment which often has high message latency. We present a modified pipelined time stepping algorithm based on delayed pipelining and reduced communication strategies to improve overall execution time on a distributed memory environment using MPI. Our goal is to reduce the inter-time step communications while providing adequate information for the next time step to converge. Numerical result confirms that the improved algorithm is faster than the original pipelined algorithm and sequential time stepping algorithm with spatial parallelisation alone. The improved algorithm is most beneficial for fine granularity time dependent problems with limited spatial parallelisation.}},

	abstract = {{'Parareal' attempts to speed up the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by
parallelizing the time dimension.
Different solutions are obtained in parallel on different subintervals.
An iterative procedure is employed to match the solution values at the end of each subinterval with
those at the beginning of the next one.
It has been shown that insufficient 'parareal' iterations lead to an inaccurate solution, while too
many iterations waste CPU cycles without bringing any improvement to the solution.
In this paper we discuss an error control mechanism for both the classical 'parareal' time
discretization method and its adaptive variant.
This mechanism can be effectively used as a mean of controlling the number of 'parareal' iterations.
We show that bounding the difference between the solution of the fine integrator and the 'parareal'
solution by the local truncation error of the fine grid leads to a sufficient convergence criterion that
guaranties a solution that is accurate enough in a minimum number of iterations.
Tests on a nonlinear problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed error control mechanism on
the classical automatic adaptive time stepping formulation of an embedded method on the two-level
'parareal' algorithm.}},

large-scale linear-quadratic optimal control problem involving a parabolic partial differential
equation over a finite control horizon.
We consider an "all at once" discretization of the problem and formulate three iterative algorithms.
The first algorithm is based on preconditioning a symmetric positive definite reduced linear system
involving only the unknown control variables; however inner-outer iterations are required.
The second algorithm modifies the first algorithm to avoid inner-outer iterations by introducing an
auxiliary variable.
It yields a symmetric indefinite system with a positive definite block preconditioner.
The third algorithm is the central focus of this paper.
It modifies the preconditioner in the second algorithm by a parallel-in-time preconditioner based on
the parareal algorithm.
Theoretical results show that the preconditioned algorithms have optimal convergence properties and
parallel scalability.
Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.}},

The key feature is a initial rough approximation of the solution that is iteratively refined by the parallel solvers. We report a derivation of the Parareal method that uses a convergence acceleration technique to improve the accuracy of the solution. Our approach uses firstly an explicit ODE solver to perform the parallel computations with different time-steps and then, a decomposition of the solution into specific convergent series, based on an extrapolation method, allows to refine the precision of the solution. Our proposed method exploits basic explicit integration methods, such as for example the explicit Euler scheme, in order to preserve the simplicity of the global parallel algorithm. The first part of the paper outlines the proposed method applied to the simple explicit Euler scheme and then the derivation of the classical Parareal algorithm is discussed and illustrated with numerical examples.}},

	abstract = {{The applicability of the Parareal parallel-in-time integration scheme for the solution of a linear,
two-dimensional hyperbolic acoustic-advection system, which is often used as a test case for integration schemes
for numerical weather prediction (NWP), is addressed.
Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible way to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a
requirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance computer systems.
A recently introduced modification of the "parallel implicit time-integration algorithm" could successfully
solve hyperbolic problems arising in structural dynamics.
It has later been cast into the framework of Parareal.
The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for the solution of a hyperbolic flow problem,
where the initial value problem solved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial
differential equation by a finite difference method.
It is demonstrated that the modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions while
allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution.
The implementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3, partially split forward
Euler, forward-backward).
It is demonstrated that using an explicit partially split scheme for the coarse integrator allows to avoid the
use of an implicit scheme while still achieving speedup.}},

	abstract = {{We present a novel space-time parallel version of the Barnes-Hut tree code PEPC using PFASST, the
Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time.
The naive use of increasingly more processors for a fixed-size N-body problem is prone to saturate as soon as
the number of unknowns per core becomes too small.
To overcome this intrinsic strong-scaling limit, we introduce temporal parallelism on top of pepc's existing
hybrid MPI/PThreads spatial decomposition.
Here, we use PFASST which is based on a combination of the iterations of the parallel-in-time algorithm parareal
with the sweeps of spectral deferred correction (SDC) schemes.
By combining these sweeps with multiple space-time discretization levels, PFASST relaxes the theoretical bound
on parallel efficiency in parareal.
We present results from runs on up to 262,144 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P installation JUGENE, demonstrating
that the space-time parallel code provides speedup beyond the saturation of the purely space-parallel approach.}},

Parallelization of time stepping provides a new direction of parallelization and allows to employ additional
cores to further speed up simulations after spatial parallelization has saturated.
We report on numerical experiments performed on a Cray XE6, simulating a driven cavity flow with and without
obstacles.
Distributed memory parallelization is used in both space and time, featuring up to 2,048 cores in total.
It is confirmed that the space-time-parallel method can provide speedup beyond the saturation of the spatial
parallelization.}},

However, for a fixed-size simulation of this type, the efficiency of larger processor counts will saturate when the number of grid points per core becomes too small. To overcome this fundamental strong scaling limit in space-parallel approaches, we present a novel time-parallel version of the lattice Boltzmann method using the parareal algorithm. This method is based on a predictor‚Äìcorrector scheme combined with mesh refinement to enable the simulation of larger number of time steps. We present results of up to a 32√ó increase in speed for a model system consisting of a cylinder with conditions for laminar flow. The parallel gain obtainable is predicted with strong accuracy, providing a quantitative understanding of the potential impact of this method.}},

In this paper, the accuracy of solving this system by time-serial spectral deferred corrections (SDC) as well as

PFASST is based on intertwining SDC iterations with differing resolution in a manner similar to the Parareal
algorithm and uses a Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) correction to improve the accuracy of coarser SDC
iterations.
It is demonstrated that SDC and PFASST can generate highly accurate solutions, and the performance in terms of

Parallel scaling tests are reported on the Cray XE6 machine ``Monte Rosa'' on up to $16,384$ cores and on the
IBM Blue Gene/Q system ``JUQUEEN'' on up to $65,536$ cores.
The efficacy of the combined spatial- and temporal parallelization is shown by demonstrating that using PFASST

Implications of using spatial coarsening strategies in PFASST's multi-level hierarchy in large-scale parallel

The method may be used either to enhance the accuracy and range of applicability of the multiscale method in
approximating only the slow variables, or to resolve all the state variables.
The numerical scheme does not require that the system is split into slow and fast coordinates.

For the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations, these methods can add another direction for
concurrency on top of spatial parallelization.
The paper presents an implementation of the time-parallel Parareal method in a C++ domain specific language for
stencil computations (STELLA).
STELLA provides both an OpenMP and a CUDA backend for a shared memory parallelization, using the CPU or GPU
inside a node for the spatial stencils.
Here, we intertwine this node-wise spatial parallelism with the time-parallel Parareal.
This is done by adding an MPI-based implementation of Parareal, which allows us to parallelize in time across
nodes.
The performance of Parareal with both backends is analyzed in terms of speedup, parallel efficiency and
energy-to-solution for an advection-diffusion problem with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient.}},

computing power to achieve good results.
New method in this study, we present a method to solve a model describing the electrical
propagation in neuronal tissue, using parareal algorithm, coupling with parallelization space using
CUDA in graphical processing unit (GPU).
Results we applied the method of resolution to different dimensions of the geometry of our model
(1-D, 2-D and 3-D).
The GPU results are compared with simulations from a multi-core processor cluster, using
message-passing interface (MPI), where the spatial scale was parallelized in order to reach a
comparable calculation time than that of the presented method using GPU.
A gain of a factor 100 in term of computational time between sequential results and those obtained
using the GPU has been obtained, in the case of 3-D geometry.
Given the structure of the GPU, this factor increases according to the fineness of the geometry used
in the computation.
Comparison with existing method(s) To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time such a method
is used, even in the case of neuroscience.

the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today's
processors.
When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for
parallelization.
But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for
parallelization.
The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution
later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round.
Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very
different property of the time dimension into account.
We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the
existing techniques.
Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods
based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel
methods.
We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and
explaining the core ideas of the authors.

Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited. Principal advantages of the proposed method include: stability even for large time-steps, the possibility to parallelize in time over many characteristic wavelengths and large speed-ups over existing methods in situations where simulation over long times are required. Numerical examples involving the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 2D wave equation in an inhomogenous medium are presented, and the method is compared to the 4th order Runge?Kutta (RK4) method and to the use of Chebyshev polynomials.

2012 is an iterative strategy for the temporal parallelization of ODEs and discretized PDEs.
As the name suggests, PFASST is similar in spirit to a space-time FAS multigrid method performed over multiple
time-steps in parallel.
However, since the original focus of PFASST has been on the performance of the method in terms of time
parallelism, the solution of any spatial system arising from the use of implicit or semi-implicit temporal
methods within PFASST have simply been assumed to be solved to some desired accuracy completely at each sub-step
and each iteration by some unspecified procedure.
It hence is natural to investigate how iterative solvers in the spatial dimensions can be interwoven with the
PFASST iterations and whether this strategy leads to a more efficient overall approach.
This paper presents an initial investigation on the relative performance of different strategies for coupling
PFASST iterations with multigrid methods for the implicit treatment of diffusion terms in PDEs.
In particular, we compare full accuracy multigrid solves at each sub-step with a small fixed number of multigrid
V-cycles.
This reduces the cost of each PFASST iteration at the possible expense of a corresponding increase in the number
of PFASST iterations needed for convergence.
Parallel efficiency of the resulting methods is explored through numerical examples.}},

especially for complex systems where the distribution of barrier heights is very heterogeneous.
Such systems are difficult to investigate using conventional long-timescale techniques and the fact that they
tend to remain trapped in small regions of configuration space for extended periods of time strongly limits the
physical insights gained from short simulations.
We introduce a novel simulation technique, Parallel Trajectory Splicing (ParSplice), that aims at addressing
this problem through the timewise parallelization of long trajectories.
The computational efficiency of ParSplice stems from a speculation strategy whereby predictions of the future
evolution of the system are leveraged to increase the amount of work that can be concurrently performed at any
one time, hence improving the scalability of the method.
ParSplice is also able to accurately account for, and potentially reuse, a substantial fraction of the
computational work invested in the simulation.
We validate the method on a simple Ag surface system and demonstrate substantial increases in efficiency

We then demonstrate the power of ParSplice through the study of topology changes in Ag42Cu13 core-shell

In particular, one technique may be more efficient or physically more appropriate or less memory consuming than the other depending on the target of the simulation and/or on the sub-region of the computational domain. Furthermore, the coupling with FEM may circumvent some difficulties inherent to lattice Boltzmann discretization, for some domains with complex boundaries, or for some kind of boundary conditions.

	abstract = {{This work investigates the potential of an in-time parallelization of atmospheric chemical kinetics. Its numerical calculation is one time-consuming step within the numerical prediction of the air quality. The widely used parallelization strategies only allow a limited potential level of parallelism. A higher level of parallelism within the codes will be necessary to enable benefits from future exa-scale computing architectures. In air quality prediction codes, chemical kinetics is typically considered to react in isolated boxes over short splitting intervals. This allows their trivial parallelization in space, which however is limited by the number of grid entities. This work pursues a parallelization beyond this trivial potential and investigates a parallelization across time using the so called ``parareal algorithm''. The latter is an iterative prediction-correction scheme, whose efficiency strongly depends on the choice of the predictor. For that purpose, different options are being investigate and compared: Time-stepping schemes with fixed step size, adaptive time-stepping schemes and repro-models, functional representations, that map a given state to a later state in time. Only the choice of repromodels leads to a speed-up through parallelism, compared to the sequential reference for the scenarios considered here.}},

In particular we study the incompressible, unsteady N-S equations with periodic boundary condition in time. A sequential time integration limits the parallelism of the solver to the spatial variables and can therefore be an obstacle to parallel scalability. Time periodicity allows for a space-time discretization, which adds time as an additional direction for parallelism and thus can improve parallel scalability. To achieve fast convergence, we used a space-time multigrid algorithm with a SCGS smoothing procedure (symmetrical coupled Gauss‚ÄìSeidel, a.k.a. box smoothing). This technique, proposed by Vanka (J Comput Phys 65:138‚Äì156, 1986), for the steady viscous incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations is extended to the unsteady case and its properties are studied using local Fourier analysis. We used numerical experiments to analyze the scalability and the convergence of the solver, focusing on the case of a pulsatile flow.}},

@unpublished{CarlbergEtAl2016,
	abstract = {{This work proposes a data-driven method for enabling the efficient, stable time-parallel numerical solution of
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The method assumes that low-dimensional bases that accurately capture
the time evolution of the dynamical-system state are available; these bases can be computed from snapshot data by proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) in the case of parameterized ODEs, for example. The method adopts the parareal framework
for time parallelism, which is defined by an initialization method, a coarse propagator that advances solutions on a coarse
time grid, and a fine propagator that operates on an underlying fine time grid. Rather than employing usual approaches for
initialization and coarse propagation (e.g., a typical time integrator applied with a large time step), we propose novel datadriven
techniques that leverage the available time-evolution bases. The coarse propagator is defined by a forecast (proposed in
Ref. [11]) applied locally within each coarse time interval, which comprises the following steps: (1) apply the fine propagator
for a small number of time steps, (2) approximate the state over the entire coarse time interval using gappy POD with the local
time-evolution bases, and (3) select the approximation at the end of the time interval as the propagated state. We also propose
both local-forecast initialization (i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied sequentially) and global-forecast initialization
(i.e., the local-forecast coarse propagator applied over the entire time interval with global time-evolution bases). The method
is particularly well suited for POD-based reduced-order models (ROMs). In this case, spatial parallelism quickly saturates, as
the ROM dynamical system is low dimensional; thus, time parallelism is needed to enable lower wall times. Further, the timeevolution
bases can be extracted from readily available data, i.e., the right singular vectors arising during POD computation.
In addition to performing analyses related to the method‚Äôs accuracy, speedup, and stability, we also numerically demonstrate
the method‚Äôs performance. Here, numerical experiments on ROMs for a nonlinear convection‚Äìreaction problem demonstrate
the method‚Äôs ability to realize near-ideal speedups; global-forecast initialization with a local-forecast coarse propagator leads
to the best performance}},

	abstract = {{The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and \{RANS\} or \{DES\} turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. \{MPI\} and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using \{CUDA\} compatible GPGPUs.}},

One approach to overcome this barrier is to use methods that are parallel in time. These methods have the potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted to space versus the amount devoted to time. Here, we present

Time-parallel algorithms face the difficulty of providing correct initial conditions for all the sub-intervals which impact the convergence rates. Parareal overcomes this difficulty by using an approximate trajectory. It has become popular in recent years for long transient simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics, fusion, reacting flows). This paper presents an approach for reliable implementation of Parareal with detailed models of power systems including saturation. Windowing approach is proposed for improving the convergence. Parareal is compared with the Newton-based time-parallel method. Effectiveness of the algorithm is analyzed by parallel emulation using extensive case studies on 10-generator 39-bus system and 327-generator 2383-bus system for various disturbances.

Recently developed techniques for approximating oscillatory scalar functions by rational functions, and accelerated algorithms for computing functions of discretized differential operators are exploited.

For symmetric positive definite (SPD) system u ‚Ä≤ ( t ) + A u ( t ) = g ( t ) arising from semi-discretizing time-dependent PDEs, if we fix the G -propagator to the Backward-Euler method and choose for F some L -stable time-integrator it can be proven that the convergence factors of the corresponding parareal algorithms satisfy œÅ ‚âà 1 3 , ‚àÄ J ‚â• 2 and ‚àÄ œÉ ( A ) ‚äÇ [ 0 , + ‚àû ) , where œÉ ( A ) is the spectrum of the matrix A .

The parareal algorithms using these two methods for the F -propagator are denoted by Parareal-TR and Parareal-Gauss4. In this paper, we propose a strategy to let these two parareal algorithms possess such a uniform convergence property. The idea is to choose an L -stable propagator F Àú and on each coarse time-interval [ T n , T n + 1 ] we perform first two steps of F Àú , then followed by J ‚àí 2 steps of F . Precisely, for the Trapezoidal rule we select the 2nd-order \{SDIRK\} method as the F Àú -propagator, and for the 4th-order Gauss \{RK\} method we select the 4th-order Lobatto III-C method as the F Àú -propagator.

	abstract = {{In this work, we propose two-level space-time domain decomposition preconditioners for parabolic problems discretized using finite elements. They are motivated as an extension to space-time of balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioners. The key ingredients to be defined are the subassembled space and operator, the coarse degrees of freedom (DOFs) in which we want to enforce continuity among subdomains at the preconditioner level, and the transfer operator from the subassembled to the original finite element space. With regard to the subassembled operator, a perturbation of the time derivative is needed to end up with a well-posed preconditioner. The set of coarse DOFs includes the time average (at the space-time subdomain) of classical space constraints plus new constraints between consecutive subdomains in time. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are weakly scalable in time, i.e., we can efficiently exploit increasing computational resources to solve more time steps in the same total elapsed time. Further, the scheme is also weakly space-time scalable, since it leads to asymptotically constant iterations when solving larger problems both in space and time. Excellent wall clock time weak scalability is achieved for space-time parallel solvers on some thousands of cores.}},

The algorithm can be used to model grounded source IP surveys that show EM induction effects as well as airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys that exhibit IP effects. IP effects are most often approximated as static or modelled in the frequency domain, using frequency dependent electrical conductivity. It is difficult to translate the frequency dependent conductivity approach directly to the time domain in a computationally efficient manner. We take an alternative approach in which we model IP relaxations in time using the stretched exponential function. We incorporate this IP model into a direct time-stepping discretization of the quasi-static time-domain Maxwell equations. We show that modelling of IP effects with this stretched exponential approach is asymptotically equivalent to the commonly used Cole-Cole model of IP transformed to the time-domain. We have implemented our algorithm using efficient numerical methods that allow it to tackle large scale problems and are amenable to use in inversion. In particular we have developed a parallel time-stepping technique that allows us to compute transient electric fields at multiple time-steps simultaneously. We demonstrate the behaviour of the stretched exponential model of IP decay as well as the efficiency of our algorithm by applying it to synthetic numerical examples that simulate a grounded source IP survey with significant EM effects and a concentric-loop airborne EM sounding over a chargeable body.}},

MGRIT is a scalable and multilevel approach to parallel-in-time simulations that nonintrusively uses existing time-stepping schemes, and in a specific two-level setting it is equivalent to the widely known parareal algorithm. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we present a two-level MGRIT convergence analysis for linear problems where the spatial discretization matrix can be diagonalized, and then apply this analysis to our two basic model problems, the heat equation and the advection equation. One important assumption is that the coarse and fine time-grid propagators can be diagaonalized by the same set of eigenvectors, which is often the case when the same spatial discretization operator is used on the coarse and fine time grids. In many cases, the MGRIT algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and we demonstrate numerically that the theoretically predicted convergence rates are sharp in practice for our model problems. Second, we explore how the convergence of MGRIT compares to the stability of the chosen time-stepping scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that a stable time-stepping scheme does not necessarily imply convergence of MGRIT, although MGRIT with FCF-relaxation always converges for the diffusion dominated problems considered here.}},

	abstract = {{The need for parallelism in the time dimension is being driven by changes in computer architectures, where performance increases are now provided through greater concurrency, not faster clock speeds. This creates a bottleneck for sequential time marching schemes because they lack parallelism in the time dimension. Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an iterative procedure that allows for temporal parallelism by utilizing multigrid reduction techniques and a multilevel hierarchy of coarse time grids. MGRIT has been shown to be effective for linear problems, with speedups of up to 50 times. The goal of this work is the efficient solution of nonlinear problems with MGRIT, where efficiency is defined as achieving similar performance when compared to an equivalent linear problem. The benchmark nonlinear problem is the $p$-Laplacian, where p=4 corresponds to a well-known nonlinear diffusion equation and $p=2$ corresponds to the standard linear diffusion operator, our benchmark linear problem. The key difficulty encountered is that the nonlinear time-step solver becomes progressively more expensive on coarser time levels as the time-step size increases. To overcome such difficulties, multigrid research has historically targeted an accumulated body of experience regarding how to choose an appropriate solver for a specific problem type. To that end, this paper develops a library of MGRIT optimizations and modifications, most important an alternate initial guess for the nonlinear time-step solver and delayed spatial coarsening, that will allow many nonlinear parabolic problems to be solved with parallel scaling behavior comparable to the corresponding linear problem.}},

With current trends in computer architectures leading towards systems with more, but not faster, processors, space--time concurrency is crucial for speeding up time-integration simulations. In contrast, traditional time-integration techniques impose serious limitations on parallel performance due to the sequential nature of the time-stepping approach, allowing spatial concurrency only. This paper considers the three basic options of multigrid algorithms on space--time grids that allow parallelism in space and time: coarsening in space and time, semicoarsening in the spatial dimensions, and semicoarsening in the temporal dimension. We develop parallel software and performance models to study the three methods at scales of up to 16K cores and introduce an extension of one of them for handling multistep time integration. We then discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches and their benefit compared to traditional space-parallel algorithms with sequential time stepping on modern architectures.},

It splits the time interval of interest into subintervals and computes the solution on each subinterval in parallel. The overall solution is decomposed into a particular solution defined on each subinterval with zero initial conditions and a homogeneous solution propagated by the matrix exponential applied to the initial conditions. The efficiency of the method depends on fast approximations of this matrix exponential based on recent results from numerical linear algebra. This paper deals with the application of ParaExp in combination with Leapfrog to electromagnetic wave problems in time domain.

This method makes use of the iterative preconditioned \{GMRES\} algorithm for solving the linear systems, which has seen success for fluid flow problems and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. By transforming the resulting linear system of equations, one can obtain a method which is much less computationally expensive than the untransformed formulation, and which compares competitively with other time-integration schemes, such as diagonally implicit Runge‚ÄìKutta (DIRK) methods. We develop and test several ILU-based preconditioners effective for these large systems. We additionally employ a parallel-in-time strategy to compute the Runge‚ÄìKutta stages simultaneously. Numerical experiments are performed on the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations using Euler vortex and 2D and 3D \{NACA\} airfoil test cases in serial and in parallel settings. The fully implicit Radau \{IIA\} Runge‚ÄìKutta methods compare favorably with equal-order \{DIRK\} methods in terms of accuracy, number of \{GMRES\} iterations, number of matrix‚Äìvector multiplications, and wall-clock time, for a wide range of time steps.}},

In this study, we compare two time-parallelization approaches, parallel replica dynamics (ParRep) and parallel trajectory splicing (ParSplice), that were specifically designed to address this issue for rare event systems by leveraging parallel computing resources. Using simulations of the relaxation of small disordered platinum nanoparticles, a comparative performance analysis of the two methods is presented.

Currently time-dependent EM solvers are typically parallel only in space. The sequential-in-time nature of these solvers can achieve good parallel scaling when the number of spatial mesh points per core is large. But the parallel efficiency quickly deteriorates and even saturates if spatial parallelism has been fully exploited. We proposed a new time domain EM solver to harvest parallelism in both spatial and temporal dimension. The spatial parallelism is achieved by discontinuous Galerkin formulation, and the temporal parallelism is enabled by Krylov subspace method based exponential integrator. This work results in a highly scalable parallel time domain solver which can amend the scalability issue for traditional ones.

The basic concept is to solve for large blocks of space-time unknowns instead of marching sequentially in time. The methodology is a combination of a computationally efficient implementation of a parallel-in-space-time finite element solver coupled with a posteriori space-time error estimates and a parallel mesh generator. While we focus on spatial adaptivity in this work, the methodology enables simultaneous adaptivity in both space and time domains. We explore this basic concept in the context of a variety of time steppers including $\Theta$-schemes and backward difference formulas. We specifically illustrate this framework with applications involving time dependent linear, quasi-linear, and semilinear diffusion equations. We focus on investigating how the coupled space-time refinement indicators for this class of problems affect spatial adaptivity. Finally, we show good scaling behavior up to 150,000 processors on the NCSA Blue Waters machine. This conceptually simple methodology enables scaling on next generation multicore machines by simultaneously solving for a large number of timesteps, and reducing computational overhead by locally refining spatial blocks that can track localized features. This methodology also opens up the possibility of efficiently incorporating adjoint equations for error estimators and inverse design problems, since blocks of space-time are simultaneously solved and stored in memory.}},

Such situations occur, e.g., in power engineering when electric devices are excited with a pulse-width-modulated signal. In order to solve those problems numerically we consider a recently introduced modified Parareal method with reduced coarse dynamics. Its main idea is to use a low-frequency smooth input for the coarse problem, which can be obtained, e.g., from Fourier analysis.

XBraid provides a non-intrusive approach for simulating unsteady dynamics on multiple processors while parallelizing not only in space but also in the time domain. It applies an iterative multigrid reduction in time algorithm to existing spatially parallel classical time propagators and computes the unsteady solution parallel in time. Techniques from Automatic Differentiation are used to develop a consistent discrete adjoint solver which provides sensitivity information of output quantities with respect to design parameter changes. The adjoint code runs backwards through the primal XBraid actions and accumulates gradient information parallel in time. It is highly non-intrusive as existing adjoint time propagators can easily be integrated through the adjoint interface. The adjoint code is validated on advection-dominated flow with periodic upstream boundary condition. It provides similar strong scaling results as the primal XBraid solver and offers great potential for speeding up the overall computational costs for sensitivity analysis using multiple processors}},

With recent computer architecture changes leading to stagnant clock speeds, but ever increasing numbers of cores, future speedups will be available through increased concurrency. Thus, sequential algorithms, such as time stepping, will suffer a bottleneck. This paper explores multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) for an important application area, linear elasticity. Previously, efforts at parallel‚Äêin‚Äêtime for elasticity have experienced difficulties, for example, the beating phenomenon. As a result, practical parallel‚Äêin‚Äêtime algorithms for this application area currently do not exist. This paper proposes some solutions made possible by MGRIT (e.g., slow temporal coarsening and FCF‚Äêrelaxation) and, more importantly, a different formulation of the problem that is more amenable to parallel‚Äêin‚Äêtime methods. Using a recently developed convergence theory for MGRIT and Parareal, we show that the changed formulation of the problem avoids the instability issues and allows the reduction of the error using two temporal grids. We then extend our approach to the multilevel case, where we demonstrate how slow temporal coarsening improves convergence. The paper ends with supporting numerical results showing a practical algorithm enjoying speedup benefits over the sequential algorithm.}},

	abstract = {{This paper presents a multilevel convergence framework for multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) as a generalization of previous two-grid estimates. The framework provides a priori upper bounds on the convergence of MGRIT V- and F-cycles with different relaxation schemes by deriving the respective residual and error propagation operators. The residual and error operators are functions of the time stepping operator, analyzed directly and bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically. We present various upper bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate convergence factor of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time points, the temporal coarsening factors, and the eigenvalues of the time stepping operator as parameters.  The paper concludes with supporting numerical investigations of parabolic and hyperbolic model problems. We assess the sharpness of the bounds and the quality of the approximate convergence factors. Observations from these numerical investigations demonstrate the value of the proposed multilevel convergence framework for the design of a convergent MGRIT algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature are captured by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT with F-relaxation do not yield scalable algorithms, that iteration counts increase with increasing numbers of levels, and the benefit of a stronger relaxation scheme. The theory also proves in a two-level setting, and confirms for multilevel, that L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes are more amendable to parallel-in-time integration with MGRIT than A-stable Runge-Kutta schemes.}},

	abstract = {{Gander and Petcu (ESAIM Proc 25:114‚Äì129, 2008) reported that, theoretically, the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is strongly influenced by the phase (frequency) accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. However, no numerical study has clearly shown this. Therefore, through numerical tests, we investigate the influence of the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation on the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. First, we consider a simple harmonic motion and a multi-DOF mass-spring system (MDMSS) as examples of hyperbolic PDEs using the modified Newmark-  Œ≤ method (Mizuta et al. in J JSCE 268:15‚Äì21, 1977), which can provide the exact phase of the time integration of a simple harmonic motion. Based on the results of the numerical tests, we show that the convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs is approximately independent of the parameters of parallel-in-time integration (PinT) and instead is dependent primarily on the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation. In addition, we show that reducing the number of bases in the reduced basis method (RBM) (Chen et al., in: Rozza (ed) Reduced order methods for modeling and computational reduction, MS and a modeling, simulation and applications, vol 9, Springer, Berlin, pp 187‚Äì214, 2014) causes the saturation of a decrease in an error during the parareal iteration for the MDMSS using the mode analysis method. The RBM is expected to make available accurate phase calculation in the coarse solver by maintaining the time step width as same as that of the fine solver. Second, we investigate whether the same saturation appears for the linear advection‚Äìdiffusion equation when we use the RBM. We use the time evolution basis method in the RBM for the linear advection‚Äìdiffusion equation. As a result, we show that reducing the number of bases causes the saturation of the decrease in the error in the linear advection‚Äìdiffusion equation. Based on the results of the present study, an increase in the phase accuracy of the coarse solver calculation is strongly required for better convergence of the parareal method iteration for hyperbolic PDEs. Moreover, the saturation of the decrease in the error during the parareal method iteration should be overcome when using the RBM.}},

	abstract = {{In the strong scaling limit, the performance of conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for the parallel solution of PDEs saturates. When sub-domains become small, halo-communication and other overhead come to dominate. A potential path beyond this scaling limit is to introduce domain-decomposition in time, with one such popular approach being the Parareal algorithm which has received a lot of attention due to its generality and potential scalability. Low efficiency, particularly on convection dominated problems, has however limited the adoption of the method. In this paper we demonstrate trough large-scale numerical experiments that it is possible not only to obtain time-parallel speedup on the non-linear shallow water wave equation, but also that we may obtain parallel acceleration beyond what is possible using conventional spatial domain-decomposition techniques alone. Two factors were essential in achieving this. First, for Parareal to converge on the hyperbolic problem we used an approximate Riemann solver as the preconditioner. This preconditioner introduces only dissipative errors with respect to the 3rd order accurate WENO-RK discretization used to solve the PDE system. The preconditoner is comparatively expensive and convergence is slow unless time-subdomains are short. We therefore introduce a new scheduler that we denote Communication Aware Adaptive Parareal (CAAP). CAAP increases obtainable speed-up by minimizing the time-subdomain length without making communication of time-subdomains too costly whilst also adaptively overlapping consecutive cycles of Parareal so to mitigate the impact of a relatively expensive coarse operator.}},

The time parallelization in this solver allows us to significantly exceed the computing resources used by parallelization-in-space methods and results in a correspondingly significantly reduced wall-clock time. One of the major difficulties of achieving Exascale performance for weather prediction is that the strong scaling limit ‚Äì the parallel performance for a fixed problem size with an increasing number of processors ‚Äì saturates. A main avenue to circumvent this problem is to introduce new numerical techniques that take advantage of time parallelism. In this paper, we use a time-parallel approximation that retains the frequency information of oscillatory problems. This approximation is based on (a) reformulating the original problem into a large set of independent terms and (b) solving each of these terms independently of each other which can now be accomplished on a large number of high-performance computing resources. Our results are conducted on up to 3586 cores for problem sizes with the parallelization-in-space scalability limited already on a single node. We gain significant reductions in the time-to-solution of 118.3√ó for spectral methods and 1503.0√ó for finite-difference methods with the parallelization-in-time approach. A developed and calibrated performance model gives the scalability limitations a priori for this new approach and allows us to extrapolate the performance of the method towards large-scale systems.

Parallel‚Äêin‚Äêtime exposes and exploits additional parallelism in the time dimension, which is inherently sequential in traditional methods. The rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI) method allows taking arbitrarily long time steps based on a sum over a number of decoupled complex PDEs that can be solved independently massively parallel. Hence, REXI is assumed to be well suited for modern massively parallel super computers, which are currently trending. To date, the study and development of the REXI approach have been limited to linearized problems on the periodic two‚Äêdimensional plane. This work extends the REXI time stepping method to the linear shallow‚Äêwater equations on the rotating sphere, thus moving the method one step closer to solving fully nonlinear fluid problems of geophysical interest on the sphere. The rotating sphere poses particular challenges for finding an efficient solver due to the zonal dependence of the Coriolis term. Here, we present an efficient REXI solver based on spherical harmonics, showing the results of a geostrophic balance test, a comparison with alternative time stepping methods, an analysis of dispersion relations indicating superior properties of REXI, and finally, a performance comparison on the Cheyenne supercomputer. Our results indicate that REXI not only can take larger time steps but also can be used to gain higher accuracy and significantly reduced time to solution compared with currently existing time stepping methods.}},

It is well known that such a CGC procedure is often the bottleneck of speedup of the parareal algorithm. For an ODE system with initial-value condition $u(0)=u_0$ the idea can be explained as follows. First, we apply the $\mathcal{G}$-propagator to the same ODE system but with a special condition $u(0)=\alpha u(T)$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is a crux parameter. Second, in each iteration of the parareal algorithm the CGC procedure will be carried out by the so-called diagonalization technique established recently. The parameter $\alpha$ controls both the roundoff error arising from such a diagonalization technique and the convergence rate of the resulting parareal algorithm. We show that there exists some threshold $\alpha^*$ such that the parareal algorithm with diagonalization-based CGC possesses the same convergence rate as that of the parareal algorithm with classical CGC if $|\alpha|\leq \alpha^*$. With $|\alpha|=\alpha^*$, we show that the condition number associated with the diagonalization technique is a moderate quantity of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (and therefore the roundoff error is small) and is independent of the length of the time interval.

	abstract = {{Lagrangian particle methods based on detailed atomic and molecular models are powerful computational tools for studying the dynamics of microscale and nanoscale systems. However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest oscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time simulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised parallel-in-time algorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate long-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up coarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the continuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its macroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional macroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to supervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictor-corrector type algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the mean-field prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g., consistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that sets SPASD apart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity macroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even inconsistent with the microscale description, but SPASD anticipates the deviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics. We first present the algorithm and analyze its theoretical speedup, and subsequently we present the accuracy and convergence of the algorithm for the time-dependent plane Poiseuille flow, demonstrating that SPASD converges exponentially fast over iterations, irrespective of the accuracy of the predictor. Moreover, the fluctuating characteristics of the stochastic dynamics are identical to the unsupervised (serial in time) DPD simulation. We also compare the performance of SPASD to the conventional spatial decomposition method, which is one of the most parallel-efficient methods for particle simulations. We find that the parallel efficiency of SPASD and the conventional spatial decomposition method are similar for a small number of computing cores, but for a large number of cores the performance of SPASD is superior. Furthermore, SPASD can be used in conjunction with spatial decomposition for enhanced performance. Lastly, we simulate a two-dimensional cavity flow that requires more iterations to converge compared to the Poiseuille flow, and we observe that SPASD converges to the correct solution. Although a DPD solver is used to demonstrate the results, SPASD is a general framework and can be readily applied to other Lagrangian approaches including molecular dynamics and Langevin dynamics.}},

	abstract = {{With the advent of very large scale parallel computers, it has become more and more important to also use the time direction for parallelization when solving evolution problems. While there are many successful algorithms for diffusive problems, only some of them are also effective for hyperbolic problems. We present here a mathematical analysis of a new method based on the diagonalization of the time stepping matrix proposed by Maday and R√∏nquist in 2007. Like many time-parallelization methods, at first this does not seem to be a very promising approach: the matrix is essentially triangular, or, for equidistant time steps, actually a Jordan block, and thus not diagonalizable. If one chooses however different time steps, diagonalization is possible, and one has to trade off between the accuracy due to necessarily having different time steps, and numerical errors in the diagonalization process of these almost nondiagonalizable matrices. We present for the first time such a diagonalization technique for the Newmark scheme for solving wave equations, and derive a mathematically rigorous optimization strategy for the choice of the parameters in the special case when the Newmark scheme becomes Crank--Nicolson. Our analysis shows that small to medium scale time parallelization is possible with this approach. We illustrate our results with numerical experiments for model wave equations in various dimensions and also an industrial test case for the elasticity equations with variable coefficients.}},

This study is motivated by the observation that sequential time-stepping is a computational bottleneck when attempting to implement highly concurrent algorithms, thus parallel-in-time methods are desirable. MGRIT adds parallelism by using a hierarchy of successively coarser temporal levels to accelerate the solution on the finest level. In the case of explicit time-stepping, spatial coarsening is a suitable approach to ensure that stability conditions are satisfied on all levels, and it may be useful for implicit time-stepping by producing cheaper multigrid cycles. Unfortunately, uniform spatial coarsening results in extremely slow convergence when the wave speed is near zero, even if only locally. We present an adaptive spatial coarsening strategy that addresses this issue for the variable coefficient linear advection equation and the inviscid Burgers equation using first-order explicit or implicit time-stepping methods. Serial numerical results show this method offers significant improvements over uniform coarsening and is convergent for the inviscid Burgers equation with and without shocks. Parallel scaling tests on up to 128K cores indicate that run-time improvements over serial time-stepping strategies are possible when spatial parallelism alone saturates, and that scalability is robust for oscillatory solutions which change on the scale of the grid spacing.}},

The efficacy of SWR methods is questionable, however, since in each iteration, one propagates an error across the entire time interval. In this manuscript, we introduce an adaptive pipeline approach wherein one subdivides the computational domain into space-time blocks, and adaptively selects the waveform iterates which should be updated given a fixed number of computational workers. Our method is complementary to existing space and time parallel methods, and can be used to obtain additional speedup when the saturation point is reached for other types of parallelism. We analyze these waveform relaxation with adaptive pipelining (WRAP) methods to show convergence and the theoretical speedup that can be expected. Numerical experiments on solutions to the linear heat equation, the advection-diffusion equation, and a reaction-diffusion equation illustrate features and efficacy of WRAP methods for various transmission conditions.}},

Here, we introduce the path-accelerated molecular dynamics (PAMD) method that takes advantage of distributed computing to reduce the wall-clock time of MD simulation via parallelization with respect to MD timesteps. The marginal distribution for the time evolution of a system is expressed in terms of a path integral, enabling the use of path sampling techniques to numerically integrate MD trajectories. By parallelizing the evaluation of the path action with respect to time and by initializing the path configurations from a non-equilibrium distribution, the algorithm enables significant speedups in terms of the length of MD trajectories that can be integrated in a given amount of wall-clock time. The method is demonstrated for Brownian dynamics, although it is generalizable to other stochastic equations of motion including open systems. We apply the method to two simple systems, a harmonic oscillator and a Lennard-Jones liquid, and we show that in comparison to the conventional Euler integration scheme for Brownian dynamics, the new method can reduce the wall-clock time for integrating trajectories of a given length by more than three orders of magnitude in the former system and more than two in the latter.

As a result, parallel-in-time methods, mathematical formulations which exploit additional degrees of parallelism in the time dimension, have gained increasing interest in recent years. In this work we study a massively parallel rational approximation of exponential integrators (REXI). This method replaces a time integration of stiff linear oscillatory and diffusive systems by the sum of the solutions of many decoupled systems, which can be solved in parallel. Previous numerical studies showed that this reformulation allows taking arbitrarily long time steps for the linear oscillatory parts. The present work studies the non-linear shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere, a simplified system of equations used to study properties of space and time discretization methods in the context of atmospheric simulations. After introducing time integrators, we first compare the time step sizes to the errors in the simulation, discussing pros and cons of different formulations of REXI. Here, REXI already shows superior properties compared to explicit and implicit time stepping methods. Additionally, we present wallclock-time-to-error results revealing the sweet spots of REXI obtaining either an over 6‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ higher accuracy within the same time frame or an about 3‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ reduced time-to-solution for a similar error threshold.

@article{Southworth2019,
	abstract = {{Parareal and multigrid reduction in time (MGRiT) are two of the most popular parallel-in-time methods. The basic idea is to treat time integration in a parallel context by using a multigrid method in time. If $\Phi$ is the (fine-grid) time-stepping scheme of interest, such as any Runge--Kutta scheme, then let $\Psi$ denote a ‚Äúcoarse-grid" time-stepping scheme chosen to approximate $k$ steps of $\Phi$, where $k\geq 1$. In particular, $\Psi$ defines the coarse-grid correction, and evaluating $\Psi$ should be (significantly) cheaper than evaluating $\Phi^k$. Parareal is a two-level method with a fixed relaxation scheme, and MGRiT is a generalization to the multilevel setting, with the additional option of a modified, stronger relaxation scheme. A number of papers have studied the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT. However, general conditions on the convergence of Parareal or MGRiT that answer the following simple questions have yet to be developed: (i) For a given $\Phi$ and $k$, what is the best $\Psi$? (ii) Can Parareal/MGRiT converge for my problem? This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT applied to linear problems, along with tight two-level convergence bounds, under minimal additional assumptions on $\Phi$ and $\Psi$. Results all rest on the introduction of a temporal approximation property (TAP) that indicates how $\Phi^k$ must approximate the action of $\Psi$ on different vectors. Loosely, for unitarily diagonalizable operators, the TAP indicates that the fine-grid and coarse-grid time integration schemes must integrate geometrically smooth spatial components similarly, and less so for geometrically high frequency. In the (nonunitarily) diagonalizable setting, the conditioning of each eigenvector, ${v}_i$, must also be reflected in how well $\Psi{v}_i \sim\Phi^k{v}_i$. In general, worst-case convergence bounds are exactly given by $\min \varphi < 1$ such that an inequality along the lines of $\|(\Psi-\Phi^k){v}\| \leq\varphi \|(I - \Psi){v}\|$ holds for all ${v}$. Such inequalities are formalized as different realizations of the TAP in section 2 and form the basis for convergence of MGRiT and Parareal applied to linear problems.}},

@unpublished{SpeckEtAl2019,
	abstract = {While many ideas and proofs of concept for parallel-in-time integration methods exists, the number of large-scale, accessible time-parallel codes is rather small. This is often due to the apparent or subtle complexity of the algorithms and the many pitfalls awaiting developers of parallel numerical software. One example of such a time-parallel code is pySDC, which implements, among others, the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time (PFASST). Inspired by nonlinear multigrid ideas, PFASST allows to integrate multiple time-steps simultaneously using a space-time hierarchy of spectral deferred corrections. In this paper we demonstrate the application of performance analysis tools to the PFASST implementation pySDC. We aim to answer whether the code works as intended and whether the time-parallelization is as efficient as expected. Tracing the path we took for this work, we highlight the obstacles encountered, describe remedies and explain the sometimes surprising findings made possible by the tools. Although focusing only on a single implementation of a particular parallel-in-time integrator, we hope that our results and in particular the way we obtained them are a blueprint for other time-parallel codes.},
